## Introduction  
Spam emails are a major challenge in today's digital communication, often containing phishing links or irrelevant information. This project aims to classify emails as **spam** or **non-spam** using machine learning models trained on text features extracted through NLP techniques.  

---

## Features  
- Preprocessing email data (tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming).  
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF**.  
- Spam classification using **Naive Bayes** and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

---

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - Pandas  
  - NumPy  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - NLTK  
  - Joblib

This will display your Python code directly in the `README.md` file with proper syntax highlighting.

### Steps to Update the `README.md` on GitHub

1. **Open the `README.md` file** in your project directory.
2. Add the appropriate section (either linking or embedding the code) as shown above.
3. **Save the file**.
4. **Commit and push** the changes to GitHub.

To commit and push the changes:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update README to include spam_classifier.py"
git push origin main  # Or the branch you're using
